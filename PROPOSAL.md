# Project Proposal
There are various applications related to computer vision, from image processing to face recognition. Some of these projects can be seen in public spaces, including the familiar shadow that disrupts the flow of objects on a screen. This project aims to achieve similar results through hand tracking and interaction with Box2D objects on the screen.

One library that will be used in the project includes OpenCV. This library deals primarily with computer vision and will be used to track hands using the built-in webcam on a laptop. There are also various resources online, including OpenCV tutorials found on their website (https://docs.opencv.org/master/d9/df8/tutorial_root.html), that relate to video analysis and hand tracking. These resources also detail various processes behind video analysis and include http://kunalarora135.blogspot.com/2015/07/getting-started-with-opencv-and-hand.html, http://simena86.github.io/blog/2013/08/12/hand-tracking-and-recognition-with-opencv/, https://s-ln.in/2013/04/18/hand-tracking-and-gesture-detection-opencv/, and https://picoledelimao.github.io/blog/2015/11/15/fingertip-detection-on-opencv/. These resources will ultimately guide the setup and development of the hand tracking for this project.

Following the completion of the video analysis portion with OpenCV and given an appropriate amount of time to implement, Box2D will be used to incorporate interactions between the tracked hand and other objects on screen. Different geometric shapes will be present on the video feed, and waving a tracked hand around the screen will cause these shapes to move and interact accordingly. While there are significantly fewer resources available on Box2D that on OpenCV, official documentation (http://box2d.org/manual.pdf) along with examples (https://github.com/vanderlin/ofxBox2d) and other guides (http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-5-physics-libraries/) will be invaluable in contributing to the success of this portion of the project.

In summary, the project will consist of two parts. The first and main portion involves tracking a hand using OpenCV with a basic webcam and outline the exterior hull of the hand at the minimum. Afterwards, and given enough time, Box2D will be utilized to incorporate geometric objects into the video feed and allow for interaction between the tracked hand and these figures. Despite my lack of knowledge in computer vision along with using these libraries, splitting the project up into these two parts will allow for more flexibility, allowing me to fully comprehend the various ideas included with the project and ensure code quality. In addition, my interest in OpenCV along with limited experience with game development will be helpful in being able to complete the project and handle Box2D if the library is utilized.
