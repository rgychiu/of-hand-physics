# Project Proposal
Understanding the relationship between facial features and perceived attractiveness has long been a prominent question throughout history. As a result, various theories exist, including the idea of facial symmetry as well as proportionality, in an attempt to correlate desirability with the position and alignment of different facial characteristics. This project will utilize the rule of fifths, a principle that utilizes proportionality in determining attractiveness, along with the FaceTracker OpenFrameworks library to classify the appeal of recognized faces.

Many theories deal with the idea of symmetry or proportionality playing a major role in desirability. The rule of fifths builds upon these ideas and states that an attractive face can be divided relatively evenly into five regions, with each region being approximately equivalent to the width of an eye. Peak appeal occurs with the remaining facial features, specifically the width of the base of the nose and the distance between the edge of the face and the beginning of the eye, each span approximately one-fifth of the face. Using this principle in tandem with the OpenFrameworks facial recognition library will allow for the classification of various faces.
